******Race Day Project*****

Annual race is just around the corner! This year, we have a lot of participants. You have been hired to write a program that will register runners for the race and give them instructions on race day.

As a timeline, registration would look like this:registration-timeline

Here’s how our registration works. There are adult runners (over 18 years of age) and youth runners (under 18 years of age). They can register early or late. Runners are assigned a race number and start time based on their age and registration.

Race number:

Early adults receive a race number at or above 1000.
All others receive a number below 1000.
Start time:

Adult registrants run at 9:30 am or 11:00 am.
Early adults run at 9:30 am.
Late adults run at 11:00 am.
Youth registrants run at 12:30 pm (regardless of registration).
But we didn’t plan for runners that are exactly 18! We’ll handle that by the end of the project.

If your code is working correctly, all of these should be true:

Runners who are 25 years old and registered early will run at 9:30 am.

Runners who are 25 years old and did NOT register early will run at 11:00 am.

Runners who are 16 years old and registered early will run at 12:30 pm.

Runners who are 16 years old and did NOT register early will run at 12:30 pm.


******You have two ways to resolve this.


******Calculator Project******
A calculator using 
JS => Functions, Classes, callback.
CSS => Flexbox.
HTML=>  Buttons and Divs.

Enjoy! HAPPY CODING.

********* Golf Code *******
In the game of golf, each hole has a par, meaning, the average number of strokes a golfer is expected to make in order to sink the ball in the hole to complete the play. Depending on how far above or below par your strokes are, there is a different nickname.

Your function will be passed par and strokes arguments. Return the correct string according to this table which lists the strokes in order of priority; top (highest) to bottom (lowest):

Strokes	    Return
1	        "Hole-in-one!"
<= par - 2	"Eagle"
par - 1	    "Birdie"
par	        "Par"
par + 1	    "Bogey"
par + 2	    "Double Bogey"
>= par + 3	"Go Home!"
par and strokes will always be numeric and positive. We have added an array of all the names for your convenience.



********** Sleep Debt Calculator******
Did you know that giraffes sleep 4.6 hours a day? We humans need more than that. If we don’t sleep enough, we accumulate sleep debt. In this project we’ll calculate if you’re getting enough sleep each week using a sleep debt calculator.

The program will determine the actual and ideal hours of sleep for each night of the last week.

Finally, it will calculate, in hours, how far you are from your weekly sleep goal.
